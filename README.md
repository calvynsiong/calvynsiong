### Hi folks ðŸ˜€


# Welcome to my Github Profile

I am currently undergoing my sophomore year at McMaster University for Software Engineering. I enjoy learning **Typescript**, **Python**, and **React**. Currently focusing on learning full stack development, with an interest in delving deeper into backend engineering.

Right now, I am learning the Spring Boot framework, and I am interested in learning about ASP.NET CORE as well.

**Please check out my [personal website](https://calvynsiongv2.netlify.app/)!** I will continue to improve it in the future.

I am open to collaborate with others on a project.

Fun Fact: Chris Bosh knows how to code in Javascript. Wonder if he knows closures and async/await.
