### Hi folks ðŸ˜€


# Welcome to my Github Profile

I am a McMaster University graduated who studied software engineering. I enjoy learning **Typescript**, **Python**, and **React**. Currently focusing on learning full stack development, with an interest in delving deeper into backend engineering.

**Please check out my [personal website](https://calvynsiongv2.netlify.app/)!** 

I am open to collaborate with others on a project.

Check out my project section for a breakdown of the different repos

Fun Fact: Chris Bosh knows how to code in Javascript. Wonder if he knows closures and async/await.
